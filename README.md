## Summary
This site explains how search engine optimization works, but my role in the site was adding semantic tags and alt texts to make the site more accessible. Aditionally I modified the css to be more efficient. Things like accessibility and semantic tags do assist in seearch engine optimization which was the big take away from this project.
